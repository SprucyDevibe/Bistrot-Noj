# Shader-Project-00a

A simple Minecraft Bedrock shader, that is made with the intention to satisfy one's artistic view and creative mind.

The shader is currently in its very first steps to completion, as the time and environment system is currently unimplemented in the shader. please use it to your interest.

The shader only bring a small amount of features, as it is being re-worked from the pieces of its predecessor.
